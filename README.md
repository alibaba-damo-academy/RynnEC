## 🤗 Demo

It is highly recommended to try our [online demo](https://huggingface.co/spaces/Alibaba-DAMO-Academy/RynnE) first.

Otherwise, you can launch a gradio app locally:

```bash
python inference/gradio_demo.py --model-path Alibaba-DAMO-Academy/RynnEC-2B

options:
  --model-path MODEL_PATH, --model_path MODEL_PATH
  --port SERVER_PORT, --server_port SERVER_PORT
  	Optional. Port of the model server.
```

## 🕹️ RynnEC-Bench
RynnEC-Bench evaluates the models in two key areas: `object cognition` and `spatial cognition`, evaluating a total of `22` embodied cognitive abilities.

## 🚀 Training

### Step1: Prepare training data
To use our training code, please organize the annotation files in the following format:
```json
[
    // image QA
    {
        "image": ["images/xxx.jpg"],
        "conversations": [
            {
                "from": "human",
                "value": "<image>\nWhat are the colors of the bus in the image?"
            },
            {
                "from": "gpt",
                "value": "The bus in the image is white and red."
            },
            ...
        ]
    },
    // Video QA
    {
        "video": ["videos/xxx.mp4"],
        "conversations": [
            {
                "from": "human",
                "value": "<video>\nWhat are the main activities that take place in the video?"
            },
            {
                "from": "gpt",
                "value": "The main activities that take place in the video are the preparation of camera equipment by a man, a group of men riding a helicopter, and a man sailing a boat through the water."
            },
            ...
        ]
    },
    // Video-object QA (mp4 file)
    {
        "video": ["videos/xxx.mp4"],
        "conversations": [
            {
                "from": "human", 
                "value": "<video>\nWhat is the color of <region>?"
            }, 
            {
                "from": "gpt", 
                "value": "The color is red."
            }
        ],
        "masks": [
            {
                "frame id": {"size": [1080, 1920], "counts": "mask rle"},
                "frame id": {"size": [1080, 1920], "counts": "mask rle"}
            }
        ],
    },
    // Video-object QA (image files)
    {
        "video": ["videos/xxx/0.png", "videos/xxx/1.png", "videos/xxx/2.png", ...],
        "conversations": [
            {
                "from": "human", 
                "value": "<video>\nWhat is the color of <region>?"
            }, 
            {
                "from": "gpt", 
                "value": "The color is red."
            }
        ],
        "masks": [
            {
                "frame id": {"size": [1080, 1920], "counts": "mask rle"},
                "frame id": {"size": [1080, 1920], "counts": "mask rle"}
            }
        ],
        "mask_ids": ["the frame index of each mask in the video list"],
        "timestamps": ["timestamp of video frames"],
    },
    // Image-object QA
    {
        "video": ["images/xxx.jpg"],
        "conversations": [
            {
                "from": "human", 
                "value": "<video>\nWhat is the relationshipw between object1<region> and object2<region>?"
            }, 
            {
                "from": "gpt", 
                "value": "They are side by side."
            }
        ],
        "masks": [
            {"size": [1080, 1920], "counts": "mask rle"},
            {"size": [1080, 1920], "counts": "mask rle"}
        ],
    },
]
```

### Step2: Prepare training script
We provide some templates in `scripts/train` for all stages. You can modify the variables to fit your settings of data and models based on them. For example:
```
  --data_folder ./datasets \
  --data_path stage4.json \
  --model_path Alibaba-DAMO-Academy/RynnEC-2B \
  --vision_encoder DAMO-NLP-SG/SigLIP-NaViT \
```

### Step 3: Start training
Now you can start training with your training scripts:
```
# stage1
bash scripts/train/stage1.sh
# stage2
bash scripts/train/stage2.sh
...
```

### Step 4: Merge LORA weights
If you use `lora` in the training stage, use the following command to merge the LORA weights after training:
```
python tools/merge_lora_weights.py --model_path checkpoints/stage4/checkpoint-xxx --save_path checkpoints/stage4_merge
```



## ✅ Evaluation

### 1.RynnEC-Bench
Please prepare the datasets and question files used for evaluation [here](benchmark/README.md).

```bash
# for object property cognition
bash scripts/eval/eval_object_property.sh

# for object segmentation
bash scripts/eval/eval_seg.sh

# for spatial cognition
bash scripts/eval/eval_spatial.sh
```

Note:

Fill in the API_KEY, URL in the [metrics.py](benchmark/metrics.py) first.
